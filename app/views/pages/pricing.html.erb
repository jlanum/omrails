	<div class="question">
	<h4>DOES CUSTOM DATA MATTER?</h4>
	<p>
	Yes. Seasonal or perishable products - such as white sandals, Easter baskets or citrus scented soaps - should be monitored closely to ensure profitability.  With a Basic or Professional account, your store can manage enough products so that profit is impacted.
	</p>
	
	</div>
	<div class="question">
	<h4>DO I NEED TO CONNECT MY POS SYSTEM?</h4>
	<p>
	Not necessary. You can join as a Free, Basic or Professional customer and quickly select the items you want to track from our product database.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
	<h4>WHO ELSE USES THESE SOLUTIONS?</h4>
	<p>
	Lifecycle pricing, as it’s known in the executive retail world, is a systematic, science-based process that helps minimize steep clearance markdowns. Currently, every large retailer in America is utilizing this knowledge. MySaleTable believes that every small retailer in America should also be using these solutions.

	<div class="question">
	<h4>IS MY ACCOUNT AUTOMATICALLY BILLED?</h4>
	<p>Yes. If you’ve created a Basic or Professional account we bill in (3) month increments. If you ever have questions regarding your billing, send us an email at stores@mysaletable.com and we’ll respond quickly.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
	<h4>IS IT EASY TO UPGRADE MY ACCOUNT?</h4>
	<p>Yes. Simply log in to your account and select the plan you’d like to switch to. It’s an easy process that takes less than a minute. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
	<h4>HOW MANY STORES CAN I SUPPORT?</h4>
	<p>I don’t yet know the answer to this question, but if you hold, please, I will soon ascertain the boundaries of our database.  I assume we should talk about the store count limit here, too. Let’s discuss.</p>
